    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Christopher Kelly.
    \n\nI\'m into sports and music.
        \n\nNot like I\'m fanatical about these things, I just like them. I mean sure, I have
        strong opinions about Rush, and the Toronto Maple Leafs, but if you want to wear your Canadiens jersey and
        listen to the Biebs, then I\'m okay.
        \n(I draw the line at Nickleback and the Bruins).
        \n\n\nUsually my downtime consists of playing video games.
        \nI\'m into RPG with good stories that offer the most freedom for the player.
        \n\n I also play the guitar. Not extensively mind you, but I know a couple of classic riffs that I really enjoyed learning
        \n\nAnother thing I love is classic movies. Mostly comedies.
        \nMel Brooks, Monty Python, and anything with Leslie Neilson. I don\'t consider myself a huge movie buff but I
        will often catch myself making vague references that few people would understand.
